    title: 'From Culinary Dreams to Marketing Journeys: A Story of Faith, Perseverance, and Growth',
  
    excerpt: `When she first stepped into the gates of FEU Roosevelt, she wasn’t entirely sure if she belonged. Marketing Management wasn’t even her first dream. She once imagined herself wearing a chef’s apron and creating dishes instead of campaigns. But life, as it also tends to do, had other ideas. 
 
"At first, I had no idea where I was going," she says. "But gradually, things began to make sense. 
 
It wasn't a textbook that opened her eyes-it was a professor who introduced her to the fact that marketing isn't necessarily about selling, It's about storytelling. It is also about creating connections and about making people feel something. That realization lit a spark she never expected, transforming uncertainty into purpose. 
 
Her FEU journey wasn’t just defined by lectures and exams. It was on the sleepless nights preparing org projects, designing shirts for the bookstore, editing materials for the Marketing Department, and leading student organizations. 
 
“I always believed that it’s better to do your best now than regret it later,” she says. And so, she arrived for her peers, for her professors, for her obligations. Arriving, she came to see, was more potent than being the smartest person in the room. 
 
The third year was the hardest. Being the Treasurer of the Manager’s Club, being the founder of the Rotaract Club of FEU Roosevelt Cainta, as well as balancing a feasibility study. It was like being responsible for more than one person's burden. 
 
“That was the year I realized that leadership isn’t just about making decisions,” she says. “It’s about empathy, patience, and understanding that not everyone has the same drive—and that’s okay.” 
It was a humbling season — one that taught me that passion is powerful, but people matter more. 
 
There were mornings when it seemed impossible to get out of bed, nights when tears and doubts crept quietly. Moments when quitting felt easier. “But God never left me,” I say with a soft smile. “Every accomplishment, every breakthrough I owe it all to Him. 
 
Through faith, she found strength. Through friends who understood the struggles of student leadership, she found comfort. And through family, she found the reason to keep going.  
 
One of her fondest experiences in FEU Roosevelt was being a member of SINAG TAMARAW, the university's annual talent, creativity, and Tamaraw pride celebration. 
 
The Sinag Tamaraw Logo was crafted from the shape of the famous FEU Tamaraw face, a symbol of unity and strength. The initial theme was inspired by the Heads in the Clouds concert at Manila, an image that combined sound, color, and energy of youth. 
 
When I joined FEU, the first activity I went to was SINAG TAMARAW 2022," she remembered. That moment made me think of something. I said, 'What if I could create a logo for this event in the future?' 
 
Flash forward to SINAG TAMARAW 2023, and that dream was realized. She created a logo and forwarded it to one of the Student Council officers. It eventually got approved and became part of the event's official marketing materials. 
 
The logo duplicated the Tamaraw face's shape to make it look new but recognizable—something which was still grounded in FEU heritage but indicated a new, innovative phase. 
 
For the theme, the inspiration was taken from the concert Heads in the Clouds. She envisioned the students to feel as if they were on cloud nine, far from academic worries, drifting in a dreamy, magical world where they could merely enjoy and be themselves. The "Retro Rewind" tagline perfectly encapsulated the nostalgic vibe of the band that performed during the concert. 
 
Graduation didn’t suddenly make her feel ready. When she first became a digital marketing associate, she admits, she didn’t fully know what she was doing. 
 
 I live by the quote, ‘Faith it till you make it.’ Because the truth is, you won’t always feel ready. But you can have faith and move forward anyway. 
She discovered that theories taught in class provided a strong foundation, but real growth came from applying them outside. It was the combination of academics and org experiences that molded her into the professional she is today. 
 
If she could define her transition from student to professional in one word, it would be wild. Unexpectedly. Fast-paced. Beautiful in its chaos. “I never thought I’d end up here,” she admits. “But everything somehow fell into place.” 
 
Retrospectively, she sees the contrast between her student-self and professional-self. Not who she is, but how she navigates—more confidently, more resiliently, more ready to compartmentalize work life from personal life. 
 
And if she were to advise present-day FEU students on just one thing? She says it without hesitation: 
“Experience everything. Don’t just stick to the classroom. Join orgs. Work part-time. Meet people. Be flexible. The more you experience, the better you’ll learn how to connect with others. That’s what marketing is all about.” 
 
For her, FEU wasn’t just about academics. It was about transformation. It was about learning that showing up matters, that faith sustains, and that growth comes from courage, not certainty. 
 
This is the Tamaraw way—taking the next chapter not with fear, but with faith, not with reluctance, but with heart. And as she moves increasingly into the world, she bears not only a degree, but a testament of strength, determination, and elegance.`,

    title: 'Taking the Next Chapter — The Transitions That Define Us',
    category: 'Lifestyle'
    excerpt: `Every Tamaraw story begins in transition. 
It’s not a quiet shift, but a test — a moment where uncertainty meets courage. At FEU Roosevelt, transition isn’t just about change; it’s about becoming. From the first day on campus to the last walk across the stage, each Tamaraw learns that growth doesn’t happen alone. It happens together — through shared struggle, discovery, and resilience. 
And so begins the story of three Tamaraws — each stepping into FEUR with different hopes, fears, and strengths, unaware that their paths would intertwine and redefine not just who they are, but who they become. 
 
The Shy Dreamer → The Grounded Leader 
She entered her first class quietly, unsure of herself and too afraid to speak up. Surrounded by confident voices, she often questioned if she even belonged. But college has a way of bringing people out of their shells. Group projects, new friends, and mentors who believed in her helped her discover her voice. 
Every small success — every “you can do it” — built her confidence piece by piece. 
 
Now, she stands at the front of the room, leading with poise and purpose. Her transition taught her that confidence isn’t something you’re born with — it’s something you build through courage, persistence, and the people who lift you up. 
 
The Silent Observer: The Voice of Clarity 
She was the quiet one — reserved, thoughtful, often watching from the sidelines. She excelled in silence, letting others take the spotlight. But inside, she was unsure — about her choices, her future, and whether her voice mattered. 
FEU Roosevelt gave her the space to step out. Through student organizations, mentors, and friends who believed in her potential, she found the courage to speak and lead. 
 
Today, she’s the steady voice in every room, the one who brings perspective and calm. Her transition taught her that silence can be strength — but courage turns it into leadership. 
 
The Naive Optimist: The Purpose-Driven Achiever 
She came in full of energy and dreams — straightforward, eager to experience everything at once. But the reality of college hit hard: responsibilities, rejections, and the pressure to perform. There were times she questioned if her optimism still had a place here. 
 
 
One Story; One Legacy 
Three Tamaraws. Three different beginnings. 
But they didn’t walk this path alone. Along the way were friends who stayed through sleepless nights, classmates who turned into allies, and mentors who guided them toward clarity. 
Through these connections, they discovered a shared truth: 
The Tamaraw Way isn’t about who finishes first, but who grows through the journey. 
As they stand together now, ready to take the next chapter beyond FEU Roosevelt, they carry one legacy: every transition, no matter how uncertain, is an invitation to become something greater. 
At FEUR, transition isn’t the end of the story; 
It's the start of the next one.`,

title: '“The Heart That Never Left: A Teacher’s Journey Through Time”',
excerpt: `When Sir Jason Carlos reflects on his journey, he smiles, the same smile that you see when one's story comes full circle. "Next year will be my 30th year of teaching,” he says with quiet pride. “I started my career here in 1995, but really, my story began long before that as a student walking through these same halls.”  
 
A true -blooded Rooseveltian, he graduated from his high school at Roosevelt College in 1991, once dreaming to become an architect or interior designer “Those dreams didn’t happen,” he recalls, “because my family couldn’t afford to send me to those programs.” 
 
But life had a different plan. Inspired by a passionate fourth-year teacher, he turned toward education, a decision that would define not just his career but also his life. “She was really an excellent teacher,” he says. “That’s when I realized I wanted to do the same — to teach, to inspire.” On June 5, 1995, after passing the qualifying exam, he officially began his journey as a full-time elementary teacher. “That day marked the start of my lifelong journey with Roosevelt,” he says. 
 
Back in 1995, Roosevelt was a picture of tradition. “We had green boards, chalk, and erasers,” he laughs. “Our version of multimedia back then was a cassette player, VHS tapes, and an overhead projector.” 
 
With limited technology, the classrooms were always buzzing — packed with up to 55 to 60 students per class. "It was tough but rewarding. The spirit of learning was there, and that mattered more than the tools we had.” 
 
What defined Roosevelt then, he says, were three timeless values: Science, Progress, and Industry — the pillars proudly etched in the old school seal. “Beyond that,” he adds, “Roosevelt believed in developing the mind, body, and spirit. We’ve always aimed to shape students holistically.” 
 
The institution’s most transformative moment came in 2016, when FEU officially acquired Roosevelt College. “There were mixed emotions,” he admits. “We were uncertain and worried about our jobs, our future, our identity. But FEU absorbed all existing employees. That decision meant a lot to us.” The transition wasn’t just about management; it was about merging two legacies. “FEU and Roosevelt share the same heart,” he explains. “Both believe in quality education, discipline, and progress. And interestingly, both share the same colors — green and gold — a symbol of unity between the two institutions.” When the pandemic struck years later, that shared spirit of innovation paid off. “We were already prepared with our learning management system before COVID,” he notes. “That readiness shows the FEU Roosevelt mindset always ahead of the curve.”  
 
For someone who began his career with chalk and VHS tapes, Sir Jason has seen the full spectrum of educational evolution “Gone are the days when students just sat and listened quietly,” he laughs. “Today’s learners are curious, explorative, and tech-savvy.” 
 
The challenge for teachers, he says, is to bridge the gap between generations. “We’re migrants in the world of technology; our students are natives. We must adapt, attend seminars, learn new tools, and even understand how to use AI in education.” He emphasizes that technology should never replace learning; it should enhance it. “We must use AI to our advantage, not fear it. And we have to teach students how to do the same.” 
 
Despite the changes, the core of Roosevelt remains the same. “The heart of teaching here has always been student-centered,” he says. “We’re focused on developing what I call the 5 C’s — Collaboration, Communication, Creativity, Critical Thinking, and Computer Literacy. These are essential skills for 21st-century learners.” 
 
For him, discipline is still the key to it all. "Discipline is the precedent of learning,” he declares firmly. “Once you have discipline, learning naturally follows. It’s the value that has guided me through every challenge.” 
 
After nearly three decades of teaching, his pride shines brightly when he talks about his students. “Seeing them succeed in their careers that’s the true reward. That’s when you realize your work has made a difference.” As Roosevelt moves closer to its centennial celebration — around 2034 or 2035 — he reflects on what has kept the institution strong for almost a century. “There’s a principle I’ve always believed in,” he says with a knowing smile. ‘Proper Planning Prevents Poor Performance.’ “That’s what keeps this institution thriving: foresight, dedication, and passion. And that’s what I hope the next generation of Tamaraws will carry forward.” 
 
If he had to describe Roosevelt’s evolution in one phrase, he answers without hesitation: “Discipline is the precedent of learning.” It's not a philosophy; it's the pulse of a teacher who has witnessed it all. From chalkboards to computers, from Roosevelt College to FEU Roosevelt, there remains one constant truth: the spirit of learning survives, adapting with the years but never losing its essence.`,
